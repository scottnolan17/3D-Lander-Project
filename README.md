# 3D-Lander-Project

This was my final project for my Intro to Game Development course. It's a 3D game showcasing physics and collision, but is conceptually very simple; just try to fly the lander to the green destination box without crashing. This was a solo project in C++.

Features of this project:
  - 3 dimensional physics inlcuding particle emissions, gravity, and player controlled thrust
  - K-tree partitioned landscape to allow fast collision detection
  - Randomly generated goal position
  - Multiple camera perspectives
  - Dynamic lighting
  
If you want to try it out, download the bin file, extract the data file inside, and run the .exe. 

W and S for vertical thrust, A and D for rotational thrust, arrow keys for lateral thrust, f1 for free cam (click and drag), f2-5 for fixed cameras.
